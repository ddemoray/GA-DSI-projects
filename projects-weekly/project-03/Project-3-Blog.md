title: Intro to Probability Part 2 Lab - Project 3 / Blog
---

For our third assignment we were asked to complete a lab that visualized data from an example we discussed in class - DMV waiting time.  The prompt defined the data as gamma distribution.  First step was visualizing this distribution with four hyperparameter combinations.  In addition to allowing us to visualize what the distribution looks like given a range of different hyperparameters, it also allows one to visually approximate a hyperparameter combination that is representative of our data set.

Next an explicit data set was defined which we used to create a 3d visual representation of the probability of each tuple taking place.  After visualizing this data set we were to use the minimize function to calculate the minimum likely point. Subtracting this from 1 gives us the maximum likely point which is also statistically the most probable point.  Lastly we were to calculate statistics surrounding the data points in this distribution

I struggled immensely on this project - while I'm grateful for the opportunity to push myself to really make an attempt to bridge the theory we've been discussing in class to this lab, I can't say that I confidently understand how this lab would be applicable to an entry level data job.  I'd like to better understand the tools built into scipy that would allow us to do linear regression and other statistical analysis.  This would allow me to better understand how to work with and visualize data in the Python environment and give me a stronger foundation before jumping into the complexity of this problem.  I tend to learn best when doing project based learning, and perhaps I didn't understand the original topics discussed in class to allow me to complete this lab.
